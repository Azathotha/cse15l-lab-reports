## Step 4
![step_4](https://github.com/Azathotha/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/images/4/step_4.png) <br />
Keys pressed: `<up><enter>` <br />
The `ssh cs15lfa23ke@ieng6.ucsd.edu` command was 1 up in the search history, so I used up arrow to access it, then use `enter` key to run it.

## Step 5
![step_5](https://github.com/Azathotha/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/images/4/step_5.png) <br />
Keys pressed: `git clone <ctrl + v> <enter>` <br />
First I typed `git clone` command, then I use ctrl-v to paste the ssh code link I copied from my repository by clicking the copy button, then use `enter` key to run it.

## Step 6
![step_6](https://github.com/Azathotha/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/images/4/step_6.png) <br />
Keys pressed: `cd l <tab><enter>` `bash t <tab><enter>` <br />
First I change working directory to lab7 folder by typing `cd L`, then press tab to auto fill the command to `cd Lab7`, and use enter to run it. Then I do the same to auto fill `bash t` command to `bash test.sh`, then use `enter` key to run it.

## Step 7
![step_7](https://github.com/Azathotha/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/images/4/step_7.png) <br />
Keys pressed: `vim L <tab> .java <enter>` `<i><backspace><2><esc> :wq <enter>` <br />
First I typed `vim L`, then I use tab to auto fill it to `vim ListExamples`, then keep typing `.java`, then use enter key to run it.

My curser was at the place where I exit the file last time, which is at the right of "1" in "index1", so I press `i` to enter insert mode, use `backspace` to delete "1", and type "2", go back to mormal mode using `esc`, then type `:wq` to save and exit the file.

## Step 8
![step_8](https://github.com/Azathotha/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/images/4/step_8.png) <br />
Keys pressed: `<up><up><enter>` <br />
The `bash test.sh` command was 2 up in the search history, so I used up arrow to access it, then use `enter` key to run it.

## Step 9
![step_9](https://github.com/Azathotha/cse15l-lab-reports/blob/main/images/4/step_9.png) <br />
Keys pressed: `git add L <tab> <enter>` `git commit -m "fix index 1 -> 2 <enter>"` `git push <enter>`<br />
I type the three command above and use `enter` key to run them, using `tab` to auto fill ListExamples.java file. `git add` add the changed file to be part of next commit; `git commit` add commit of the file locally, `git push` upload the files commited to the GitHub repository.
